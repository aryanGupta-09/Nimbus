- **Camera**: For sky analysis feature
- **Storage**: For saving sky photos
- **Network State**: For checking connectivity

## Troubleshooting

- **Location not updating?** Check that location permissions are granted and GPS is enabled
- **Sky analysis not working?** Verify your Gemini API key is correctly set in `apikey.properties`
- **Missing sensor data?** Not all devices have barometric pressure or humidity sensors
- **Weather not refreshing?** Check network connectivity and background refresh settings
